- Total Freedom Rate by Region

    An ANOVA was conducted to compare the differences in freedom score for the three regions.

- Total Happiness Score by Region

    An ANOVA was conducted to compare the differences in happiness score for the three regions. 
    There was a significant difference in happiness (p = 0.04) where Europe and South America had a higher median happiness score than Asia.

A regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between a countries total protests and their happiness score. There was no significant relationship between the two variables, indicating that the number of protests a country has does not have an impact on the countries happiness score.
